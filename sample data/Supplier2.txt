Diamondback Axis Sport 27.5" Mountain Bike - 2014






For 2014, Diamondback introduces a hardtail that settles a long-standing debate in mountain bike circles: 26 or 29? For the last 10 years, mountain biking enthusiasts have been seeking a way to get more out of their bikes without having to invest in major advances in suspension. There had to be a simple solution to the 26 inch wheel problem. When 29 inch wheels came around, everyone started to get excited. Thanks to advances in frame design and disc brakes, there was no reason to stick to one wheel size. People soon came to realize that 29 inch wheels were heavy however and that they took a lot more energy to spin up. Enter 27.5". Finding that happy medium was easier than anyone would have though. Just split the difference. With 27.5" wheels, you will find the quick acceleration that 29ers just can't match with traction and rolling benefits that 26" wheels only dream of. Enter the Diamondback Axis Sport.
